Oh life    is bigger,    it's bigger than you.
            {Am}                              {Em}
And you are not me, the lengths that I will go to.
                           {Am}
The distance in your eyes.
{Em}                  {Em}(II) Ebm {Dm}                      {G}
   Oh no, I've said     too    much, I've said enough.
                         {Am}                  {Em}
That's me in the corner,    That's me in the spot light,
                    {Am}           {Em}
Losing my religion.    Trying to keep up with you.
      {Am}
And I don't know if I can do it.
{Em}                  {Em}(II) Ebm {Dm}                           {G}
   Oh no, I've said     too    much, I haven't said enough.
                                     {F} Fsus2
I thought that I heard you laughing.
{F}                {G}         {Am}    {Am}(II)
I thought that I heard you sing.
  {F}          Fsus2  {F}   {G}   {Am}
I think I thought I saw you try.

  Every whisper,
             {Em}                                 {Am}
Every waking hour, I'm choosing my confessions.
          {Em}
Trying to keep eye on you.
       {Am}
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool.
{Em}                            {Dm}                {G}
   Oh no, I've said too much.    I said enough.
               {Am}               {Em}
Consider this,    consider this hint of the century.
               {Am}                {Em}
Consider this,    the slip, that brought me to my knees pale.
{Am}                               {Em}
What if all these fantasies come    flaming aground.
{Em}(II)   {Dm}       {G}
Now I've said too much.
                                     {F} Fsus2
I thought that I heard you laughing.
{F}                {G}         {Am}    {Am}(II)
I thought that I heard you sing.
  {F}          Fsus2  {F}   {G}   {Am}   {G}
I think I thought I saw you try.

That was just a dream.
{C}                 /               {C}                 {Am}
  That was just a dream.   That's me in the corner.
                 {Em}                              {Am}
That's me in the spot light, losing my religion.
          {Em}                       {Am}
Trying to keep up with you.  And I don't know if I can do it.

   Oh no, I've said     too    much.

I haven't said enough.

I think I thought I saw   you try.
    {F}        Fsus2  {F}      {G} {Am}      {Am}(II)
But that was just a dream,      try, cry, why try.
{F}        Fsus2  {F}      {G}        {Am}            {G}      /
That was just a dream,   just a dream, just a dream, dream.
