{G}         {B7}                         {Em}        {D} {C}
Yesterday, all my trouble seemed so far away
         {D}                    {G}
Now it looks as though there here to stay
    {Em}   {A}       {C}      {G}
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Sudenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday come suddenly.

{B7}       {Em}
Why she had to go
          {C}        {D}       {G}
I don't know she would't say.

I said something wrong now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
